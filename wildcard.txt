WILDCART Implementation.

RULES:

	if '*' is present when expansion happend is going to be substitute with all the visible file and direcotory's names N.B. it has to be outside quotes
	if characters are present before or after '*' their are goin to be considereted the start end/or the end of the string. so '*' is going to fill what in between trying to match any file or directory names present in that folder. if no matche occur then blank is going to be sobtitute

HOW TO DO IT?:

when I met a '*' outside quotes I should start to contestualizing it. it means that I need to unserstand if it is isolated or attached to other symbols/characters. If it is alone I can simply expand it to every name founded in the directory.
If not alone or it has somenthing attached before or after.
If somenthing is attached before it could be a path and this has to be checked. If somenthing is attached after is a delimeter for the expansion (I mean the sobstitution has to match that end).

0. It has to be done has first thing during expansion.
1. Analays contest
2. If alone just expand it
3. If somenthing came before verify if '/' is present if it is do it for another directory
